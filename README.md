# hello-world
A introductory repository for my start in computer programming world  
I am primarly a Materials Scientist with a strong experience in the synthesis and characterization of emerging nanomaterials and thin-films for renewable energy and optoelectronic applications. I have a multidisciplinary background in materials science, solid-state physics, physical chemistry, and electrochemistry. I am enthusiastic about Data Analytics to read the energy-related problems and contribute to solve them.
