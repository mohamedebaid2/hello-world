# hello-world
A introductory repository for my start in computer programming world  
I am primarly a Materials Scientist with a strong experience in the synthesis and characterization of new nanomaterials and thin-films for solar energy harvesting applications. I have a multidisciplinary background in materials science, solid-state physics, physical chemistry, and electrochemistry. I am enthusiastic about Data Science tools to solve energy-related problems.
